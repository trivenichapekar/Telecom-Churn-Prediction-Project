# Telecom-Churn-Prediction-Project
# Business  Objective
Customer churn is a big problem for telecommunications
companies. Indeed, their annual churn rates are usually higher than
10%. For that reason, they develop strategies to keep as many clients
as possible.
This is a classification project since the variable to be predicted is
binary (churn or loyal customer). The goal here is to model churn
probability, conditioned on the customer features.
# Dataset Details 
The datafile 'Churn.csv' contains a total of 20 features for 5000
customers. Each row corresponds to a client of a telecommunications company for
whom it has collected information about the type of plan they have contracted, the
minutes they have talked, or the charge they pay every month.
